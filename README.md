# Poolboy
Poolboy is a python library used to create thread pools with kernel threads (from threading.Thred) green threads and any other threads that are compatible with the library. A Queue is used to deque tasks from the working threads and enqueue them inside of the executor classes. Queue operations are not wrapped inside of locks because the Queue class in the queue module is already thread safe. We can pass custom timeouts through poll timeout, put timeout that set timers on put and get queue operations. We can also pass custom thread options used by the underlying worker classes.
